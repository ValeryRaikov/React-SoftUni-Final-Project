Introduction
------------

This project is an e-commerce platform designed to offer a diverse range of clothing for all demographicsâ€”women, men, and children. Users can browse various product categories, view detailed information in the "About" section, log in to their accounts, and manage their shopping carts. Once authenticated, users unlock additional features for a more personalized shopping experience. Additionally, the website includes an Admin panel that is accessible exclusively to administrators. Once logged in, admins have the ability to create, update, delete, and preview products. The server side handles all API requests and manages database operations. The platform is equipped to handle both client-side and server-side errors gracefully, ensuring that users are promptly informed and guided through any issues that arise.
